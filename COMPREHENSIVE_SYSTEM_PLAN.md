# School Management System - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document presents a complete architectural plan for implementing a comprehensive School Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with TypeScript. The system will provide robust functionality for managing all aspects of school operations including student information, attendance tracking, grade management, fee processing, timetable scheduling, and communication through announcements and messaging.

The system supports multiple user roles (administrators, teachers, students, and parents/guardians) with role-based access control to ensure data security and privacy.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication and Role Management**
2. **Student and Teacher Management**
3. **Class and Subject Management**
4. **Attendance Tracking**
5. **Grade and Assignment Management**
6. **Fee and Payment Processing**
7. **Timetable Scheduling**
8. **Messaging and Announcements**
9. **Reporting and Analytics**
